After logging in, navigate to:

```
/book
```

- View, edit, or delete existing books
- Use AJAX-powered search
- Enjoy pagination

---

## üîç AJAX Search

- Real-time search on the book list page
- Uses native JavaScript `fetch()` to request `/book/search?q=...`
- Results are dynamically updated without page reload

---

## üì© AJAX Form Submission with Validation

Book form submission (creation & edit) uses jQuery + AJAX:

- Valid data: redirects to book list
- Invalid data: errors shown near each field (styled with Bootstrap's `is-invalid`)
- Implemented in `assets/book-form.js`
- Rendered form uses `novalidate` and `#book-form` for precise JS control

You can customize validation styling in `book/_form.html.twig`.

---

## üìÑ Pagination

- The book list at `/book` is paginated
- Powered by `KnpPaginatorBundle`
- Displays 10 books per page

---

## üîß Testing

Run all functional and controller tests:

```bash
docker exec -it library_app-php-1 php bin/phpunit
```
