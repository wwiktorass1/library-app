## üë®‚Äçüíº Authentication

### Register

- Visit [http://localhost:8000/register](http://localhost:8000/register)
- Create a new account (email + password)

### Login

- Go to [http://localhost:8000/login](http://localhost:8000/login)
- Use your credentials to log in

---

## üìñ Book Management

After logging in, navigate to:

```
/book
```

You can:
- Create a new book
- View, edit, or delete existing books
- Use AJAX-powered search
- Enjoy pagination

---

## üîç AJAX Search

- Real-time search on the book list page
- Uses native JavaScript `fetch()` to request `/book/search?q=...`
- Results are dynamically updated without page reload

---

## üì© AJAX Form Submission with Validation

Book form submission (creation & edit) uses jQuery + AJAX:

- Valid data: redirects to book list
- Invalid data: errors shown near each field (styled with Bootstrap's `is-invalid`)
- Implemented in `assets/book-form.js`
- Rendered form uses `novalidate` and `#book-form` for precise JS control

You can customize validation styling in `book/_form.html.twig`.

---

## üìÑ Pagination

- The book list at `/book` is paginated
- Powered by `KnpPaginatorBundle`
- Displays 10 books per page

---

## üîß Testing

Run all functional and controller tests:

```bash
docker exec -it library_app-php-1 php bin/phpunit
```

---

This project includes tests for:

- ‚úÖ Creating books with valid & invalid data

## üì° AJAX Form Submission

This project supports asynchronous (AJAX) form submission for book creation:

- When submitted via JavaScript (`XMLHttpRequest`), the `/book/new` endpoint:
  - Returns `204 No Content` on successful creation.
  - Returns `400 Bad Request` and renders form partial with validation errors if input is invalid.

Example error response (partial HTML):

```html
<div class="form-error-message text-danger title-error">
    This value should not be blank
</div>
```

---

## üìê Architectural decisions

This project follows **Symfony best practices** with clear separation of concerns:

- **MVC pattern** is used to isolate business logic (`Controller`, `Entity`, `Twig`).
- **Service layer** handles logic beyond controllers (e.g., data processing, validation).
- **Repository pattern** is used for custom queries and search logic.
- **FormType classes** help encapsulate form and validation logic.
- **Doctrine ORM** handles all data persistence with proper constraints.
- **AJAX interactions** are handled via `XMLHttpRequest` and Symfony responses.
- **Validation is layered**:
  - Entity-level constraints (e.g., `@Assert`)
  - Form-level error rendering
  - AJAX-safe validation feedback

## üí° Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Preventing circular references in entity serialization | Used groups in API responses and disabled circular reference handler |
| Supporting both AJAX and regular form submissions | Detected `isXmlHttpRequest()` and rendered partial form template on failure |
| Making validation testable in both form and API | Reused the same `BookType` with constraints in all controllers and ensured test coverage |
| Avoiding route conflicts (e.g. `/book/search` vs `/book/{id}`) | Ordered routes properly in controller (specific before dynamic) |

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t library-app .

# Run the container in production mode
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -e APP_ENV=prod library-app
```

### 2. After the container is running:

```bash
# Run database migrations
docker exec -it <container_id> php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --no-interaction

# Warm up the cache
docker exec -it <container_id> php bin/console cache:warmup
```

> Replace `<container_id>` with the actual container ID from `docker ps`.
